<h1 class="text_center">For investors</h1>
<p class="text_left">Our company, operating under the brand name "<b>apex4.biz</b>", and the "<b>APEX Store
Premium</b>" exchange, is a newly established organization in Poland, but bringing together
well experienced PL/SQL and JavaScript MLE developers. This includes programmers
with Oracle <b>OCP</b> and <b>OCM</b> quality certification. Our engineers - programmers, have a lot
of experience working for large and medium-sized companies in Poland. At the same time
having recommendations from these very companies. Unfortunately, our brand outside of
Poland, is not yet recognized in the wider world market.</p>
<p class="text_left">Therefore, we are looking for investors up to the amount of <u>five hundred thousand
Polish zlotys</u> (PLN - that's about <u>120,000 Euros</u>). In order to create a new limited liability
company, on the territory of the city of Gdynia. The company would take over our newly
created brands, and the trading exchange of finished applications APEX. By investing in
our company, you become its shareholder, up to the amount of contributed cash capital.
</p>
<p class="text_left">The course of the investment itself will be divided into several stages. Andthe time
and deadlines for the implementation of these stages, will depend on the number of
investors, and the cash capital we manage to raise. so first, we will form a new limited
liability company, registered in the Polish court register, creating a new office - the
secretariat of the board of directors. Next, we want to create our own recording studio,
forrecording educational and promotional videos, typically in YouTube format. These
videos will be recorded in English, German, Arabic and Russian.
Focusing mainly on education and showing the actual capabilities of the tools, which are
Oracle Cloud (OCI) and Oracle Application Express (Oracle APEX). This requires hiring a
video editor, and an actor-model English speaker as a presenter. The vlogs posted on our
YouTube channel will be accompanied by links, to the products of our exchange. And the
basic products that we want to promote and sell in this way are ready-made applications
for the APEX platform, and video courses in different languages. An additional service, on
request, will be custom programming of individual applications and Oracle databases.</p>
<p class="text_left">The second stage, is to recruit and hire PL/SQL and JavaScript MLE language
developers on a permanent basis. If our campaign on YouTube, succeed - that is, the
reach among viewers, and the number of subscribers, will increase steadily. And we will
win permanent contracts for software production and development, with specific clients
from all over the world. Then it will be possible,
creating stable and full-time jobs for programmers from Poland.</p>
<p class="text_left">Our company is mainly focused on targeting its software development offerings in the
APEX platform, to business clients who speak Arabic with Saudi dialect from Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. Therefore, we need investors who finance our
company's hiring of an Arabic translator necessarily with Saudi dialect. And also experts in
tax law of Middle Eastern countries - mainly Saudi Arabia and Qatar. And this would be the
third and final stage of our investment.</p>
<p class="text_left">However, it is fair to say that it is very risky to invest in companies in the software
and educational film production industry. At the moment, we are not able to predict what
the potential net profit of our company will be. According to the SWOT analysis, we know
that in this particular market, there are very low entry thresholds, which is a risk. But there
are also low thresholds for exiting the market, which is a chance, to save at least some
capital.</p>
