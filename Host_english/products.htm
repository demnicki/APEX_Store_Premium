<p class="text_left">Through our "APEX Store Premium" exchange, you can also lease cloud
    computing on Oracle's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service
    Corporation. And that's without having to register an account with <a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle.com</a>. With the
    button
    "plus" or "minus", you can adjust the monthly subscription, which is <u>120 euros gross</u>, for <u>20
    gigabytes</u> of disk space. Additional components, such as the Oracle Enterprise 23ai
    database, or the APEX platform - is completely free. For increasing the space by another 20
    gigabytes, you simply pay a multiple of the basic subscription.
</p>
<p class="text_left">This is a good solution for a business customer who is just testing a cloud solution.
    However, our team recommends that you use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, directly on
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle.com</a>.</p>
