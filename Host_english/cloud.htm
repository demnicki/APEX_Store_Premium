<h1 class="text_center">Oracle Cloud</h1>
<p class="text_left">Without a shadow of a doubt, most IT executives around the world know that cloud
solutions drastically reduce the cost of maintaining a company's IT infrastructure. For two
reasons. The first reason, is the lower cost of hardware resources. Leasing a server,
including additional components such as hard drives, processors and software licenses, is
cheaper than buying these components outright. And the second reason is that managing
a server in the cloud, is very easy. And it can be done by a person who is not a specialist
in this field. First of all, we no longer need to hire a highly-paid server administrator or
database administrator. The average server administrator earns about 5,000 euros a
month, and the same amount is earned by a database administrator. Using a cloud
service, practically all issues, such as management of a virtual computer network, Internet
domains, virtual machine instances, database instances - we can click for ourselves, on
the user interface. And this can be done by the CEO (manager) of your company himself.
Any cloud components that your company needs and uses are ordered, and installed in
the cloud, by clicking on the appropriate menu items, in the cloud account manager panel.</p>
<p class="text_left">Following this line of thought. We know that in the global cloud market, Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure service is the best performer, dethroning its competitors - <b>Microsoft
Azure</b>, <b>Amazon Web Service</b>, or <b>Google Cloud</b>. If only because of the lowest prices for
leasing hardware resources. And also for access, to the world's most popular low-code
platform Oracle Application Express, based on the operation of a standalone instance of
Oracle database version 23ai.</p>
