<h1 class="text_center">Affiliate program</h1>
<p class="text_left">Dear Sirs. This is an offer to earn while supporting our advertising campaign. We
want to offer you our affiliate program, which can be used by any user around the world.
Our program gives you two opportunities to earn in our project.
</p>
<p class="text_left">The first option is to promote our website on social media. Each newly registered
user, has an individual permalink assigned to his profile, as well as a financial account
maintained in Euro currency. The permalink, at the very end, has a four-digit number,
which is the user's ID in our database. Each time a new user on a new device clicks /
accesses the page under this permalink - URL, your account in our system will be credited
with the amount of <u>one euro and fifty euro cents net</u>. And as soon as the amount of your
account balance exceeds the amount of <u>five hundred euros</u>, then you will be able to
transfer this money to your bank account, specifying the IBAN number.</p>
<p class="text_left">If you have a large reach on your social media, all you have to do is post your
permalink on your </b>Facebook</b>, <b>Instagram</b>, or <b>TitTok</b> profile. And if more than <u>335 people</u>
click on that link - you've already earned <u>five hundred euros</u> on a pure basis.</p>
<p class="text_left">The second opportunity, to make money, is for developers of the PL/SQL language
and Oracle Application Express platform, if you have some ready-made APEX application
written by you, in any language, such as English, Arabic, or German. Then you can sell
this application in our exchange under the brand "APEX Store Premium", for a fixed price
in Euro currency, set by you. And so, for example, if a customer in our exchange, puts
several ready-made APEX applications, in his shopping cart. And one of these
applications will be yours for the price of ten euros. Then if the customer pays for the entire shopping cart, you automatically have those ten
euros credited to your account. And if this balance exceeds the amount of <u>five hundred
euros</u>. Then, you will be able to transfer these funds to yourself in your account. You do
not need to issue any invoices or sign any contracts. All you have to do is register and pay
the basic subscription (<u>4.99 euros</u>).</p>
