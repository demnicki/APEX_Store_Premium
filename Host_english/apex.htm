    Nowadays, the big phenomenon in the software development market worldwide is,
    of course, <b>low-code</b> and <b>no-code</b> platforms. It is these platforms that very dramatically
    reduce the cost of hiring programmers for any government organization or private
    company. Simply put, a company manager, instead of paying for many hours of
    programmer's work, can cobble together for himself many of the solutions he needs in the
    application he is using, on the interface. What can be clickable in a low-code platform
    creates a particular look for your website or application, as the manager intended. On the
    other hand, those issues that cannot be clickable, the PL/SQL and JavaScript MLE
    language technology developer will program with his own code.
    Ultimately, however, the number of hours a programmer must work is generally <u>
        80
        percent less
    </u> than in an organization that does not use low-code platforms.

    And similar to the situation in the cloud market, Oracle Corporation, competes quite
    well in the market for low-code and non-code platforms. The most popular low-code
    platforms are <b>Microsoft Power Apps</b>, <b>Wix.com</b> and <b>Bubble</b>. On the other hand, above
    them all, it is <b>Oracle Application Express</b> that dominates. Oracle APEX, is the most
    competitive platform and in terms of price and cost. And in terms of product quality. If only
    because APEX runs on the Oracle Enterprise 23ai database engine, equipped with
    artificial intelligence. Where Oracle databases, in turn, also dominate the database vendor
    market.

    Our company offers you consultation in the implementation of cloud solutions, and
    the development of APEX applications, through video conferencing. And we also offer you
    our programming services in this particular technology. Our team of programmers has
    created complex applications, for many Polish Treasury companies, in the banking,
    insurance, logistics and pharmaceutical industries. All you have to do is write a message
    to our sales representative for a quote on the cost of developing a custom application.

    Most of our PL/SQL and JavaScript MLE language developers, as well as experts
    in the Oracle Application Express platform, provide labor services at a rate of <u>
        39 euros
        gross per man-hour
    </u>. The execution of one application, typically for a large corporate
    company, takes about one week of time. That is, the cost of making such an APEX
    application, is about <u>1,500 euros.</u>
