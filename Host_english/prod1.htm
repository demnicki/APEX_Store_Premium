<p class="text_left">Through our "APEX Store Premium" exchange, you can also lease cloud
computing on Oracle's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service
Corporation. And that's without having to register an account with Oracle.com. With the
button "plus" or "minus", you can adjust the monthly subscription, which is 120 euros gross, for 20
gigabytes of disk space. Additional components, such as the Oracle Enterprise 23ai
database, or the APEX platform - is completely free. For increasing the space by another 20
gigabytes, you simply pay a multiple of the basic subscription.</p>
<p class="text_left">This is a good solution for a business customer who is just testing a cloud solution.
However, our team recommends that you use Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, directly on
<a href="http://cloud.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle.com</a>.</p>
