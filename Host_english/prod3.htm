<p class="text_left">"Your shop" application is not a typical APEX application. First of all, this
application does not use the standard APEX template, but is just a webservice package,
to handle database queries from external technologies. For example, from mobile
applications, from pages from another server from another technology. Here, the user,
can choose for himself and purchase any website template, for example, at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">GetBootStrap</a>. And then download it for yourself, and integrate it with the Oracle database, just using our application.</p>
<p class="text_left">For the application "Your shop", includes a whole range of simple webservices, to
handle, among other things, the shopping cart, running in the template of the website in
the "BootStrap" technology. And at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">getbootstrap.com</a> itself there is indeed a very large
selection of free and premium web store templates.</p>
<p class="text_left">The application is available in Polish, English, German and Arabic.</p>
